      <h1>HISTORY</h1>
      <p>The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. 
          It is held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, 
          while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual 
          finger picks may also be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by means of a resonant 
          chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.</p>
